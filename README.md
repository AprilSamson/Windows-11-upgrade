- 1.First, you'll need to buy a USB drive. You can easily find these at any electronics store or online retailer.

Rufus is a free and lightweight software that will help you create a bootable USB drive that can be used to install Windows 11. You can download Rufus from their official website here: https://rufus.ie/ 
- 3.Insert your USB drive into your computer and open Rufus. You'll need to select the USB drive as the device, choose the Windows 11 ISO file as the bootable image and let Rufus do the rest. 
-   4.Once you've created your bootable USB drive, you need to insert it into the computer you want to install Windows 11 on. 
- 5.Boot your computer from the USB drive. You may need to change your computer's boot settings to do this. You can typically do this by pressing a key during startup (often F12) to enter the boot menu. 
- 6.Follow the prompts to install Windows 11. During the installation process, make sure to select the option to do a clean install. This will erase all existing data on your hard drive and ensure a smooth and stable installation of Windows 11. 
 7. Once the installation is complete, you should have successfully installed Windows 11 on your computer that normally cannot accept it.
